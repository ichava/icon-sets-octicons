> Octicons for the Ichava Laravel icon ecosystem: 716 SVGs across `16px` (372) and `24px` (344), vendored from `@primer/octicons`.

Requires [`ichava/core`](https://github.com/ichava/core) `^0.1` on PHP `^8.4.1 || ^8.5` and Laravel `^13`.

## Install

This pack requires [`ichava/core`](https://github.com/ichava/core) and nothing else. Nothing in the Ichava family is on Packagist yet, so the **application's** `composer.json` first names the repositories: core's [installation guide](https://github.com/ichava/core/blob/main/docs/installation.md#1-point-composer-at-the-repositories) holds the one block that lists them, core's dependencies included, and this pack's line in it is `https://github.com/ichava/icon-sets-octicons`.

Then require the pack:

```bash
composer require ichava/icon-sets-octicons
```

The service provider is discovered automatically. Core's [installation guide](https://github.com/ichava/core/blob/main/docs/installation.md) covers core's own setup.

## Quick start guide and usage

### Getting started

Seed the pack once after installing it, and again after upgrading it:

```bash
php artisan ichava::ichava-core.database seed --package=ichava/icon-sets-octicons
```

The seed is not optional: until it runs the registry holds no rows for this pack and every lookup returns nothing. No configuration is needed; the defaults are merged without publishing anything.

### Usage

Icons are addressed as `ichava/icon-sets-octicons::<variant>/<name>`. In Blade, through core's component:

```blade
<x-ichava::icon name="ichava/icon-sets-octicons::16px/home" class="w-6 h-6" />
```

Or from PHP, through core's helper:

```blade
{{ ichava('ichava/icon-sets-octicons::24px/heart')->class('w-5 h-5 text-red-600') }}
```
